## File Exists
The code conforms to the spec and has been tested to work
I was a bit confused about how stat works but im hoping in the next few excercises I'll learn
repl.it repo:https://repl.it/join/wjvgdhfb-emilybuck
The Problem:Finding a file then looking at the metadata of that file to find its size and when it was last modified
General approach:Using  stat we can access the file and get this data
Main issues: figuring out how stat works 

## fileWriter
The code doesnt conform as I couldnt use getline to take input I couldnt take in full names because the space would break it up, I didnt have time to figure out this issue so I just had to go with cin unfortunately

The Problem:Trying to access a file and read the contents 
General approach: using ofstream to access the file I can then add objects to it like in the same way you would cout

## fileReader
The code conforms to the spec and has been tested to work
repl.it repo:https://repl.it/join/fwsuuqhy-emilybuck
The Problem:Trying to read from a ifstream and output each line
General approach:using a while loop to go through each line of the file and then output it, add an extra number of lines 
Main issues: I didnt realise at the start that ifstream and ofstream were different things, that held me up for a bit
